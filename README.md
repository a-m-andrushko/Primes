This is a project written in Python on prime numbers topic. It uses _NetworkX_ library to create an evolving network of numbers (consisting of both primes and composites) which it builds based on the classification of an algorithm analysing each natural number. Additionally, the stochastic model of prime numbers network was implemented. In total, 10 000 natural numbers were subjected to analysis of both algorithms -- real and probabilistic. Consequtive examination of prime numbers' properties was done in comparison of those 2 different networks.
